CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN


8-1 Journal

Architecture: 
Compare and contrast the types of front-end development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
	
	Full stack development seems to combine a multitude of tools and languages to complete a project, more so than any other class had us do. These tools are different from one another and thus provide different experiences and challenges.  JavaScript was the most straightforward as it was similar enough to other programming languages. Express HTML is more of a markup language and thus is entirely different from programming languages. Particularly in the way it is formatted. SPAs are different in the way that they require a lot more work than the other two types of front-end development, at least based on this experience.

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

	NoSQL is very simple and makes data easy to read and understand. This is especially true if you compare it to SQL or SQLite. 

Functionality:
How is JSON different from JavaScript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

	The formatting of the two is entirely different. It is hard to compare the two since they appear entirely different from one another. JSON can be used to pass backend data to the front end.

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

	In this project we added routes, headers, and templates to replace or improve the default HTML files. This made their readability easier to understand and made updating the site faster. While these tools created for more files, each one was much easier to understand than simple having one with all the data in it. 
 
Testing:
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

	Testing was made easier using postman. It allowed me to directly connect to an API endpoint to test different CRUD functionality. From my understanding, this method is more efficient when in the process of adding and editing code. It was certainly faster than opening the site. 

Reflection:
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

	This class was my first full experience with full stack development. As such, it introduces me to an entirely new discipline within computer science and thus makes me more marketable.
